# Multi-consumer/Producer in Java and C

This is a classic concurrency problem in which there are an arbitrary number of producers and concumers all sharing access to a bounded buffer. When the buffer is empty, the consumers must sleep and when the buffer is full the producers must sleep.

This repo contains one solution implemented a few different ways in C and Java.
